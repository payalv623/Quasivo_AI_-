    "\"One of the most complex React components I built was a dynamic form builder used in an internal dashboard. It allowed users to create forms by dragging and dropping various input types (text, date, radio, etc.).\"\n\nState Management:\nI used useReducer to manage the form state because it involved nested structures — sections → fields → validations. This allowed better control and cleaner updates than useState.\n\nPerformance Optimizations:\n\nUsed React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders of individual form fields.\n\nApplied lazy loading of heavy components like date pickers using React.lazy().\n\nAdded debouncing for autosave functionality using lodash.debounce.",
